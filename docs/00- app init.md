To develop a comprehensive public transit app for major Canadian cities and ensure it meets Google Play’s publishing requirements, I’ll need to ask you some clarifying questions to identify any missing information or considerations. I’ll break this down into two main areas: **app development details** and **Google Play publishing requirements**.

### App Development Questions
To ensure your app provides accurate and useful transit information for cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, and Calgary, I need more details about your planned features and scope:

1. **Geographic Scope**:
   - Which specific Canadian cities are you targeting? For example, are you focusing on major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, and Calgary, or do you plan to include smaller cities with transit systems (e.g., Edmonton, Winnipeg)?
   A: 先针对Toronto, Vancouver
   - Will the app cover only city-specific transit systems (e.g., TTC in Toronto, TransLink in Vancouver) or also include intercity services like GO Transit or Via Rail?
   A: only cover city-specific transit systems, buses and subways

2. **Transit Data**:
   - Where will you source real-time and static transit data? For example, will you use open data feeds (e.g., GTFS data from agencies like TTC, TransLink, or STM) or partner directly with transit authorities?
   A: I dont know how to get these data, please show how to get these realtime data and the cost
   - Do you have access to real-time APIs for bus and subway schedules, or are you relying on static timetables? Real-time data is critical for accurate arrival predictions.[](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6142130?hl=zh-Ha&co=GENIE.Platform%253DAndroid)
   A: we should access the Google map from it's public APIs
   - How will you handle inconsistencies in data quality across cities? For instance, some agencies may provide real-time updates, while others only offer schedules.
   A: 我们的目标是低成本地获取有关的资料，要考虑技术复杂程度和费用

3. **Feature Details**:
   - **Route Information**: Will users input a specific route number (e.g., TTC’s 501 Queen streetcar) to get details, or will the app allow searching by origin and destination to suggest routes?
   A: yes, User should input the route number or transit name, the will get the route information and exchange route info
   - **Start/End Times**: Do you plan to show the first and last trips for each route daily, or will you include variations for weekdays, weekends, or holidays?
   A: Yes
   - **Station Names and Transfers**: Will the app display all stops along a route and highlight transfer points to other bus or subway lines? Will it include walking directions for transfers?
   A: Yes
   - **Subway Status**: How will you present subway information? For example, will you show real-time service alerts (e.g., delays, closures) or just static line maps and schedules?
   A: no real-time notification, only maps and schedules
   - **Additional Features**: Are you considering features like fare information, accessibility details (e.g., wheelchair-accessible stations), or integration with payment systems like Presto or Opus cards?[](https://www.nc2ca.com/1082.html)
   A: No

4. **User Interface and Experience**:
   - Will the app support offline functionality for schedules or maps, as some users may lack data connectivity?[](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetransitapp.droid&hl=zh_TW&gl=US)
   A: the app should work both on-line and offline, if no network service, some realtime data should limited
   - How will you handle multi-language support, given Canada’s bilingual nature (English and French, especially in Montreal and Ottawa)?
   A: the app should handle multi-language support
   - Will the app include a map view (e.g., Google Maps integration) to visualize routes and stops?
   A: If Google Map should be used or integrated in the app, that will be better.

5. **Technical Considerations**:
   - What platforms are you developing for? Google Play implies Android, but are you also planning an iOS version for broader reach?
   A: only target to Google Play at this phase, if it welcomed in market, we should work on IOS
   - How will you handle data updates to ensure schedules and service alerts remain current?
   A: the app will pull data from other services if online, it only provied static info when offline.
   - Are you planning to integrate with external services like Google Maps or Transit App for additional functionality, or will this be a standalone app?[](https://doc.bucssa.ca/new-here/transit/)
   A: 尽量集成现成的开放的平台，减少开发量

6. **City-Specific Transit Systems**:
   - For **Toronto**: Will you include TTC’s subway, streetcars, and buses, as well as GO Transit for regional travel? How will you handle Presto card integration or fare details?
   A: The app only provide transit info query, no transactions or payment involved.
   - For **Vancouver**: Will you cover TransLink’s SkyTrain, SeaBus, and buses? Will you include Compass card support?
   A: same as Toronto, not support trasactions or business
   - For **Montreal**: Will the app include STM’s metro and buses, and how will you address French-language requirements for the Opus card system?
   A: refer above
   - For **Ottawa and Calgary**: Will you include light rail systems (e.g., Ottawa’s O-Train, Calgary’s CTrain) alongside buses?
   A: refer to above
   - Are you aware that some cities (e.g., Winnipeg) lack subways, so the app would focus solely on buses?
   A: if no subway service, it only focus on buses
