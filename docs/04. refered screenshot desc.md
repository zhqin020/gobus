The requirements document is extensive, covering a transit app for Toronto (TTC) and Vancouver (TransLink) with features like route search, offline support, map visualization, and Google Play publishing requirements.

Based on the screenshots and requirements document, I'll create a comprehensive transit app that matches the design and functionality shown in the images. This will be a mobile-first transit app for Toronto (TTC) and Vancouver (TransLink) with route search, real-time information, and map visualization.
